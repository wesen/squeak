# SQL Test Data Generator

{% warning %}
This is in the extremely early stages.

For a more real-time view of the ideas being developed, see [SQL Test Data Generator](https://publish.obsidian.md/manuel/Ideas/Public/Idea+-+SQL+Test+Data+Generator) in my Obsidian vault.
{% endwarning %}

The idea is to build a small self-contained binary that can be used to quickly
scaffold relatively complex SQL schemas and test data.
